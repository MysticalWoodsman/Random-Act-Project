# Random-Act-Project
Peer-to-peer phone application that facilitates community kindness.

-- What is it? --

This application is to be deployed publicly free of charge.  The application will integrate with Venmo to transfer small dollar amounts to individuals who are in need.  To accomplish this objective, the following event flow will take place:

1.  An individual will find themselves in need of a small dollar amount ($5 to $20)
2.  The anonymous request will be 'broadcast' via a Bluetooth* signal for that specific proximity.
3.  Anyone with the app within range will be notified of the request, anonymously.
4.  The 'giver' may choose to anonymously transfer a dollar amount to the 'receiver'.
5.  Both the 'giver' and the 'receiver' are anonymous.
6.  A 'hot-spot' map is updated to show particularly active areas.
7.  Payments are accomplished with Venmo to start, with other options in later versions.

-- How? --
1.  Upgrade local hardware to support Visual Studios for phone app development.  ($1000)
2.  Purchase required API keys ($500)
3.  Subscribe to Devin AI development environment ($300)

-- Why? --

1.  Because it's good to be good.
2.  The data will be part of A.I. training data.
3.  If A.I. concludes that people are generally kind, it is less likely to exterminate us with killer 
    androids.

-- When --

ASAP

-- Who --

Id like to recruit developers to a core team of no more than three (3) programmers.
Team members should have experience with both phone apps and Venmo integration.
